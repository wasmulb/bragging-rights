# Bragging Rights!

## Link to deployed website:

## Description

For this project, our team developed a website that allows a user to track competitions (e.g. sports, card games, board games, etc.) with their friends. 

After creating a login, the user is free to add a partner by username. Then, the user(s) can add an activity (consisting of the activity type and final score) to their partnership, which will be stored in our database. The users now can track all previous games/matches to determine who has bragging rights!
